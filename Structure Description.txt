This document outlines the project directory layout for the lyric chatbot system, highlighting the frontend, model assets, dependencies, and documentation. Although the generator model has been fine-tuned offline using reinforcement learning (RL), the RL training code is not included in this repository.

models/

generator/: Contains the GPT-2–based lyric generator weights that have been fine-tuned via RL to improve lyric quality and adherence to desired styles.

genre_classifier/: Fine-tuned model for classifying lyrics into genres (Pop, Hip-Hop).

emotion_classifier/: Model for predicting emotional tone (GoEmotions 28 categories) in lyrics.

topic_classifier/: Model for detecting topics (10 predefined categories) in lyrics.

data/

prompts.txt: Plain text file listing example prompts, one per line, used to initialize lyric generation (e.g., "A heartbroken ballad under the rain").

src/

slot_manager.py: Manages and validates chat slots (genre, emotion, topic, length), including normalization and fuzzy matching.

lyric_generator.py: Core chatbot module: loads all models, constructs prompts, and generates lyrics in response to user input.

app.py: Streamlit application file that provides the chat interface. It calls lyric_generator.py based on user inputs and displays generated lyrics.
